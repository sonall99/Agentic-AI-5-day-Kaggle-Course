They are trained on existing drug databases and can generate molecules with desired properties.\n*   **Optimizing Molecular Properties:** These AI models can be guided to generate molecules that are not only potent against a target but also have favorable pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) and reduced toxicity.\n*   **\"Dreaming Up\" New Chemical Spaces:** Generative AI can explore chemical spaces that are beyond human intuition, potentially leading to entirely new classes of drugs.\n\n**3. AI for Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:**\n\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI models can rapidly screen millions of virtual compounds against a target, predicting their binding affinity and potential efficacy much faster than traditional high-throughput screening.\n*   **Toxicity Prediction:** AI is being used to predict potential toxic side effects of drug candidates early in the discovery process, helping to weed out compounds that are likely to fail in later stages. This can save significant time and resources.\n*   **Predicting Drug Combinations:** AI can analyze patient data and biological pathways to predict synergistic drug combinations that might be more effective than monotherapies, especially for complex diseases like cancer.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Preclinical and Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **Optimizing Trial Design:** AI can analyze historical trial data to design more efficient and effective clinical trials, including identifying optimal patient populations, dosage regimens, and endpoints.\n*   **Predicting Trial Success:** AI models are being developed to predict the likelihood of success for a drug candidate in clinical trials based on its preclinical data and the characteristics of the target disease.\n*   **Biomarker Discovery for Patient Stratification:** AI can identify biomarkers that predict which patients are most likely to respond to a particular drug, enabling more personalized and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Remote Monitoring and Data Analysis:** AI can analyze data from wearable devices and patient-reported outcomes during trials to provide real-time insights and identify potential issues early.\n\n**5. Specific Examples and Companies:**\n\n*   **Atomwise, Insilico Medicine, Exscientia, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, BenevolentAI** are just a few of the prominent companies at the forefront of AI-driven drug discovery. They are leveraging AI to discover novel targets, design new molecules, and accelerate the entire pipeline.\n*   Many large pharmaceutical companies are also heavily investing in their own AI capabilities or partnering with AI-focused biotech firms.\n\n**Challenges and Future Outlook:**\n\nDespite the rapid progress, challenges remain, including:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Access:** High-quality, well-annotated biological and chemical data is crucial for training effective AI models.\n*   **\"Black Box\" Problem:** While explainable AI is improving, fully understanding why an AI model makes a particular prediction can still be difficult.\n*   **Regulatory Hurdles:** The regulatory framework for AI-discovered or AI-designed drugs is still evolving.\n*   **Translational Medicine:** Bridging the gap between in silico predictions and successful in vivo and clinical outcomes remains a key challenge.\n\nHowever, the overall trend is overwhelmingly positive. AI is not just a tool for incremental improvements; it's fundamentally changing how we discover and develop new medicines, promising to bring more effective and personalized treatments to patients faster than ever before.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned, which is **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design**. This is a truly groundbreaking area within AI-driven drug discovery.\n\nLet me elaborate on what that means and why it's so significant:\n\n**What is Generative AI in this Context?**\n\nIn essence, generative AI models are trained on massive datasets of existing molecules and their properties. Think of it like showing a highly intelligent artist millions of pictures of furniture, along with descriptions of their features (e.g., \"this chair is comfortable,\" \"this table is sturdy,\" \"this lamp is stylish\"). After seeing enough examples, the artist can then start creating *new* furniture designs that have never been seen before, but which still possess the characteristics of good furniture.\n\nIn drug discovery, these AI models can:\n\n*   **\"Learn\" the Rules of Chemistry:** They implicitly learn the fundamental rules of how atoms bond together, what makes a molecule stable, and what gives it certain physical and chemical properties.\n*   **Generate Entirely New Structures:** Instead of just screening existing chemical libraries, generative AI can propose novel molecular structures that chemists might not have thought of.\n*   **Design for Specific Properties:** This is where it gets powerful. You can tell the AI:\n    *   \"Design a molecule that binds strongly to this specific cancer protein.\"\n    *   \"Make sure this molecule is soluble in water.\"\n    *   \"Ensure this molecule has a low predicted toxicity.\"\n    *   \"Generate molecules with a specific molecular weight range.\"\n\n**How Does it Work (Simplified)?**\n\nThere are a few common types of generative AI architectures used:\n\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks: a \"generator\" that creates new molecules and a \"discriminator\" that tries to tell if a molecule is real (from the training data) or fake (generated). They compete, pushing the generator to create increasingly realistic and relevant molecules.\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed \"latent space\" representation of molecules. By sampling from this latent space and decoding it, they can generate new molecules.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** RL can be combined with generative models. The AI agent learns to \"explore\" the chemical space, receiving \"rewards\" for generating molecules that meet desired criteria (e.g., high binding affinity, good predicted ADMET properties).\n\n**Why is This a Big Deal?**\n\n1.  **Breaking Out of Existing Chemical Space:** Historically, drug discovery has been limited to exploring known or slightly modified existing chemical structures. Generative AI allows us to venture into uncharted chemical territories, potentially finding entirely new therapeutic modalities.\n2.  **Speed and Efficiency:** Designing molecules is a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. AI can generate thousands or millions of candidate molecules in a fraction of the time it would take human chemists.\n3.  **Optimization:** It's not just about generating *any* molecule, but about generating *optimal* molecules. AI can simultaneously consider multiple desired properties, which is incredibly difficult for humans to do efficiently. This leads to higher quality candidates from the outset.\n4.  **Personalized Medicine:** In the future, generative AI could be used to design drugs tailored to an individual patient's specific genetic makeup or disease profile.\n5.  **Repurposing and Novel Applications:** It can help identify new uses for existing drugs or design variations that overcome resistance mechanisms.\n\n**Examples of its Impact:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine** famously used generative AI to discover a novel drug candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and advance it to human clinical trials remarkably quickly.\n*   Many other companies are using generative AI to design molecules for a wide range of diseases, from cancer and infectious diseases to neurological disorders.\n\n**In summary, generative AI for molecule design is a paradigm shift. It moves from searching for needles in a haystack to having an intelligent system that can help create the needle itself, perfectly shaped for the task.**\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design**.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
